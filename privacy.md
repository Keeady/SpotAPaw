    - Location: Your device location is collected only when you submit a sighting report, to help identify where a pet was last seen.

    - Chat Input: When you describe a sighting in the chat, we may extract structured sighting details (e.g., pet description, location, time). The chat conversation itself is not saved.

We do not collect or store:

    -Your entire chat history

    - Continuous location data

    - Unused camera or photo data

    Create and display pet sighting reports for other users

    Improve the accuracy of pet sightings

    We do not use your information for targeted advertising or sell it to third parties.

3. Data Sharing

    We may share pet sighting reports (photo, location, description) with other users of the app to support reuniting pets with their owners.

    We do not share your personal data with advertisers or unrelated third parties.

4. Data Retention

    Sightings: Stored until they are no longer relevant (e.g., after a set period or when marked resolved).

    You may manage these permissions in your device settings.
