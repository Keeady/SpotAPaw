SpotAPaw (“we,” “our,” or “us”) respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our mobile application (“App”).

1- Information We Collect

We collect only the minimum information needed to provide our service:

Pet Sighting Reports

Photo: Only the photo you select to include in a sighting report is uploaded and stored. We do not access or store other photos from your device.

Location: Your device location is collected only when you submit a sighting report, to help identify where a pet was last seen.

Chat Input: When you describe a sighting in the chat, we may extract structured sighting details (e.g., pet description, location, time). The chat conversation itself is not saved.

We do not collect or store:

Your entire chat history

Continuous location data

Unused camera or photo data

2- How We Use Information

The information we collect is used exclusively to:

Create and display pet sighting reports for other users

Improve the accuracy of pet sightings

We do not use your information for targeted advertising or sell it to third parties.

3- Data Sharing

We may share pet sighting reports (photo, location, description) with other users of the app to support reuniting pets with their owners.

We do not share your personal data with advertisers or unrelated third parties.

4- Data Retention

Sightings: Stored until they are no longer relevant (e.g., after a set period or when marked resolved).

Chat history: Not stored.

Location data: Only stored as part of the sighting report.

5- Permissions

The App requests the following permissions:

Camera & Photos: To let you select a photo for your sighting report.

Location: To attach a location to the sighting you report.

You may manage these permissions in your device settings.

6- Security

We take reasonable measures to protect your data from unauthorized access, alteration, or disclosure. However, no method of transmission or storage is completely secure.

7- Children’s Privacy

Our app is not directed to children under 13. If we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under 13, we will delete it.
