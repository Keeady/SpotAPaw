1. Information We Collect

We collect only the information necessary to operate the App.

A. Pet Sighting Reports

When you submit a sighting report, we collect:

Photo: The image you choose to upload. We do not access or collect other photos from your device.

Location Data: Collected only at the time you submit a sighting report to identify where the pet was seen.

Pet Description & Report Details: Information you enter into the report form (such as breed, color, time, and other relevant details).

B. AI Photo Processing (Google Gemini)

When you upload a photo, the image is analyzed using artificial intelligence technology provided by Google Gemini (a service operated by Google).

This processing is used solely to generate suggested pet description details to assist you in completing your sighting report.

In connection with this feature:

Uploaded photos may be transmitted securely to Google for processing.

We use the paid commercial API version of Google Gemini.

Data processed through this API is not used by us to train public AI models.

AI-generated suggestions are provided for assistance only and must be reviewed by you before submission.

Google processes data in accordance with its applicable data protection and security commitments.
